# Convex Hull Java

This project computes the convex hull of a given or newly created set of points.  
You can import a file with points or add new points by clicking in the GUI.  

**Note:** This project was developed as part of a university assignment and is my first larger project.  
If you decide to review or critique the code, please do so constructively! üòÑ

## Data Format

The program accepts point data files in the following format:

- Each point is represented on a separate line.
- Each line contains two numbers: the X and Y coordinates, separated by a space or a comma.
- By default, files use the `.points` extension.

Example:
```
10 15
20 25
30 35
```
